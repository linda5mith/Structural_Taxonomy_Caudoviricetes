# Caudoviricetes Structural Taxonomy
Complete set of Jupyter Notebooks and data files used in the analysis underlying the structural taxonomy of Caudoviricetes (dsDNA tailed bacteriophages). 

The workflows include:

-Structural protein prediction and clustering

-Pfam and functional domain annotation

-Presence/absence matrix construction

-Pairwise genome similarity calculations

-Clade inference via phylogenetic and distance-based methods

-Machine learning-based taxonomic classification

-Visualization of taxonomic structure and feature importance

These notebooks support the reproducibility and transparency of the methods used in our study and may serve as a framework for researchers aiming to explore virus taxonomy through protein structure.
